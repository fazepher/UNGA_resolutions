It describes the attractive aspects of the logit response function from the viewpoint of interpretation. The chapter illustrates the interpretation for a simple logistic model and a 2 by 2 contingency table. It also provides an introduction to the probit link function. The chapter shows how a probit regression model can be viewed as a normal regression problem with missing data. It presents an overview of other response functions including the popular angular transformation and the use of family of link functions. A general statistical problem is to model a binomial probability in terms of a vector of explanatory variables. To check the relative popularity of the probit and logit response curves, the Current Index to Statistics was to used to count the number of published statistics articles containing probit or logit in the keywords or title during different periods.},

Most papers use dyadic indicators of voting similarity between states. We propose a dynamic ordinal spatial model to estimate state ideal points from 1946 to 2012 on a single dimension that reflects state positions toward the US-led liberal order. We use information about the content of the UN's agenda to make estimates comparable across time. Compared to existing measures, our estimates better separate signal from noise in identifying foreign policy shifts, have greater face validity, allow for better intertemporal comparisons, are less sensitive to shifts in the UN' agenda, and are strongly correlated with measures of liberalism. We show that the choice of preference measures affects conclusions about the democratic peace.},

However, models using only voting data tend to obscure variation in preferences across different issues due to identification and labeling problems that arise in multidimensional scaling models. We propose a new approach to using sources of metadata about votes to estimate the degree to which those votes are about common issues. We demonstrate our approach with votes and opinion texts from the U.S. Supreme Court, using latent Dirichlet allocation to discover the extent to which different issues were at stake in different cases and estimating justice preferences within each of those issues. This approach can be applied using a variety of unsupervised and supervised topic models for text, community detection models for networks, or any other tool capable of generating discrete or mixture categorization of subject matter from relevant vote-specific metadata.},

  abstract = {The foundations of item response theory (IRT) and classical test theory (CTT) were laid in  two journal articles published only one year apart. In 1904, Charles Spearman published  his article ``The proof and measurement of two things,'' in which he introduced the idea  of~the decomposition of an observed test score into a true score and a random error generally adopted as the basic assumption of what soon became known as the CTT model for a  fixed test taker. The role of Alfred Binet as the founding father of IRT is less obvious. One  reason may be the relative inaccessibility of his 1905 article ``M\'ethodes nouvelles pour le  diagnosis du niveau intellectuel des anormaux'' published with his coworker Th\'eodore  Simon in l'Ann\'ee Psychologie. But a more decisive factor might be the overshadowing of  his pioneering statistical work by something attributed to him as more important in the  later psychological literature-the launch of the first standardized psychological test.  Spearman's work soon stimulated others to elaborate on his ideas, producing such contributions as the definition of a standard error of measurement, methods to estimate test  reliability, and the impact of the test lengthening on reliability. But, with the important  exception of Thurstone's original work in the 1920s, Binet's contributions hardly had any  immediate follow-up.},

  abstract = {Multidimensional item response theory (MIRT) is not a theory in the usual scientific sense  of the use of the word, but rather, it is a general class of theories. These theories are about  the relationship between the probability of a response to a task on a test and the location  of an examinee in a construct space that represents the skills and knowledge that are the  targets of measurement for the test. The tasks on the test are usually called test items.  Included in the development of the general class of theories are implicit assumptions that  people vary in many ways related to the constructs that are the target of the test, and  the test items are sensitive to differences on multiple constructs. An important aspect of  MIRT is that certain mathematical functions can be used to approximate the relationship  between the probabilities of the scores on a test item and the locations of individuals in  the construct space (Albert, Volume Two, Chapter 1). This chapter focuses on special cases  of MIRT models that are based on one common form for the mathematical function, the  cumulative logistic function. This particular functional form is used to relate the probability of the item score for a test item to the location of an individual in the latent space.  If this function is found to fit well a matrix of item responses obtained from administering a test to a group of individuals, then there are a number of useful results that can be  obtained from the use of this function as a mathematical model. This chapter describes  several forms of the MIRT models based on the cumulative logistic function and shows  how they can be used to provide useful information about the locations of examinees in  the multidimensional latent space.},

Fisher pointed out that, in spite of the large amount of fruitful applications of statistics, its basic principles were in a ``state of obscurity'' and that ``during the rapid development of practical methods, fundamental problems have been ignored''. Conceptually speaking, the reduction in data is accomplished by constructing a hypothetical infinite population, of which the actual data are considered a random sample. This hypothetical population is fully characterized by a probability distribution, which in turn is specified by relatively few parameters. This means that each binary Item Response Theory model should be applied to a set of data which, by design, satisfies the identification restrictions.},

In the testing context, Richardson (1936) and Ferguson  (1942) used the normal-ogive model for scaling difficulties of dichotomously scored items.  Lawley (1943, 1944) was the first to formally employ the normal-ogive model to directly  model binary item response data, using the maximum-likelihood procedure to estimate  threshold and discrimination parameters under the assumption that the observed test  score serves as a measure of the ability of the examinee; this procedure, as pointed out by  Finney (1944), was already widely known in toxicology as probit regression. Tucker (1946)  used the term ``item curve'' repeatedly to indicate the relationship between item response  and ability and in doing so anticipated the current term ``item characteristic curve.'' These  early attempts at modeling binary response data culminated in the work of Lord (1952,CONTENTS11.1 Introduction ........................................................................................................................ 167 11.2 Presentation of the Model ................................................................................................. 170 11.3 Parameter Estimation ........................................................................................................ 17711.3.1 Asymptotic Distribution of Estimators .............................................................. 178 11.4 Goodness of Fit ................................................................................................................... 182 11.5 Empirical Example ............................................................................................................. 183 11.6 Conclusion .......................................................................................................................... 184 References ..................................................................................................................................... 1851953, 1980) who, unlike the early researchers, treated ability as a latent trait to be estimated  and in doing so, laid the foundation for item response theory (IRT).},
